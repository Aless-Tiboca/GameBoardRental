# GameBoardRental

GameBoardRental is a simple web application for renting board games. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive platform for users to browse and rent various board games.
This project was a university assignment where I was restricted from using any frameworks. Currently, the backend is not implemented and the application only uses JavaScript `localStorage` for data handling at a surface level.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Sign up, log in, and manage your profile.
- **Game Listings:** Browse through a variety of board games available for rent.
- **Game Details:** View detailed information about each game.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
